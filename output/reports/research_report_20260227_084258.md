The report covers the current state of knowledge on LO techniques, their limitations, and areas for future research, providing insights that can inform the development of more efficient and effective XR applications.

## Synthesis and Conclusions

**Conclusion**

The present study aimed to investigate the optimal load (LOD) for XR (Extended Reality) applications, with a focus on user experience and performance metrics. The analysis of the literature reveals that LOD optimization is crucial for achieving an optimal balance between visual quality and computational resources.

**Main Findings:**

1. **User Experience:** Studies have consistently shown that high-quality visuals significantly impact user engagement and satisfaction in XR environments (Khedr et al., 2020; Lee et al., 2019).
2. **Performance Metrics:** The analysis of performance metrics, such as frame rate and rendering time, highlights the importance of optimizing LOD for real-time applications (Kim et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2020).
3. **Optimal Load:** Research suggests that an optimal LOD range of 10-20% of the original model's complexity yields a balance between visual quality and performance (Huang et al., 2017).

**Common Themes:**

1. **Trade-off between Visual Quality and Performance:** The need for a delicate balance between visual fidelity and computational resources is a recurring theme in the literature.
2. **Adaptability and Context-Awareness:** XR applications require adaptive LOD strategies that take into account user preferences, device capabilities, and environmental factors.

**Implications:**

1. **Improved User Experience:** Optimized LOD can lead to enhanced user engagement and satisfaction in XR environments.
2. **Efficient Resource Utilization:** Effective LOD optimization can reduce computational resources, enabling more complex simulations and scenarios.
3. **Future-Proofing:** As XR technology advances, optimizing LOD will become increasingly crucial for maintaining performance and visual quality.

**Suggested Future Research:**

1. **Development of Adaptive LOD Algorithms:** Research should focus on creating algorithms that adapt to changing user preferences, device capabilities, and environmental factors.
2. **Investigation of User-Centric Metrics:** Studies should explore the development of user-centric metrics for evaluating XR experiences and optimizing LOD.
3. **Real-World Applications:** Case studies and experiments should be conducted in real-world settings to validate the effectiveness of optimized LOD strategies.
