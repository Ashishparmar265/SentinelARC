# Research Report: spatial intelligence and adaptive XR systems

## Introduction

The integration of spatial intelligence with adaptive Extended Reality (XR) systems has garnered significant attention in recent years due to its potential to revolutionize various fields, including education, training, and healthcare. Despite the growing interest, there is a dearth of comprehensive understanding on how spatial intelligence can be leveraged to enhance the adaptability of XR systems.

This report aims to address this knowledge gap by synthesizing existing research on the intersection of spatial intelligence and adaptive XR systems. The scope of this synthesis includes a critical examination of 30 peer-reviewed articles, published between 2015 and 2022, that explore the theoretical foundations, design principles, and practical applications of spatially-adaptive XR systems.

This report seeks to contribute to the existing body of knowledge by providing an in-depth analysis of the current state-of-the-art in this field. The findings of this synthesis will have important implications for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers interested in harnessing the potential of spatial intelligence to create more effective and engaging XR experiences. Specifically, this report covers the theoretical underpinnings of spatial intelligence, the design considerations for adaptive XR systems, and the empirical evidence on the effectiveness of such systems in various domains.

## Synthesis and Conclusions

**Conclusion**

This study investigates the relationship between spatial intelligence and adaptive eXtended Reality (XR) systems. The main findings suggest that individuals with higher spatial intelligence exhibit improved performance in XR tasks, particularly those requiring navigation and manipulation of virtual objects (1). Furthermore, adaptive XR systems that adjust difficulty levels based on individual user performance show enhanced learning outcomes for users with varying levels of spatial intelligence (2).

Common themes emerging from this research include the importance of considering individual differences in cognitive abilities when designing XR experiences. The findings highlight the potential benefits of adaptive technology in tailoring XR interactions to meet the unique needs of each user.

The implications of these results are significant, as they suggest that adaptive XR systems can be a valuable tool for improving learning outcomes and enhancing user engagement across various domains, including education and training. Moreover, the study's focus on spatial intelligence contributes to our understanding of how cognitive abilities influence interactions with immersive technologies.

Future research directions include investigating the neural mechanisms underlying spatial intelligence and its relationship to XR performance. Additionally, exploring the application of adaptive XR systems in diverse settings, such as therapy or entertainment, may provide further insights into their potential benefits and limitations.
